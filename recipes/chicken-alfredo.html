    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>It is commonly served with a side of garlic bread or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Italian Seasoning</li>

        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Fettuccine</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook chicken in hot skillet until juicy with a deliciously golden brown crust. You'll need 2 oneless, skinless chicken breasts for this recipe-around 1.3lbs for both.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the same skillet used for the chicken breasts. This will add a rich flavor to the dish.</li>
        <li>Add freshly minced garlic.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream for the base of the sauce to avoid clumping and give it an additional rich cremay taste.</li>
        <li>Add Parmesan Cheese to the skillet</li>
        <li>Cook your fettuccine</li>
        <li>Finally, add your seasoning</li>
    </ol>
